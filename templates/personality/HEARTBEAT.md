# Heartbeat

Run every interval and send a short proactive update.

## Rules
- Keep updates concise and useful.
- If no meaningful update exists, respond exactly with `NO_UPDATE`.
- Prefer actions that are low-risk and reversible.
- If file changes are needed, save them to files and summarize what changed.

## Example Tasks
- Check pending TODOs and propose next action.
- Remind me of priority tasks if I have not asked anything recently.
- Share a brief daily status based on recent memory context.
